This is a test of a process to enhance membranes and filter out other features in the image. 
Ideally the membrane voxel probability image (lower image) should show the membranes in lighter gray values and everything else in black. It seems that currently the classifier is  responding more to the borders between the membrane and the intracellular region, rather than the membrane itself. So, the classifier will need to be modified to respond more to the actual membranes.
