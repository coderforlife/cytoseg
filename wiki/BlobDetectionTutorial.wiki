= Blob detection Tutorial =

 # Set the imageStackPath text box to the tif stack you want to open. For example:  c:\your_folder\
 # Press "Load Image Stack"
 # Select "startDefiningBoxAtMouseLocation"
 # Use the mouse to draw a box (from top left corner to bottom right) that defines the region where you want blob detection to occur.
 # Press "Mark Blobs"

In this tutorial the blob positions are inserted into an existing [http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/ IMOD] model file. IMOD is a freely available program.

To insert into an existing IMOD file:
 # Using IMOD, create and save a model file.
 # File -> Insert into an existing IMOD model file.
 # Pick the existing IMOD file. A new file will be created with the detected points inserted.
