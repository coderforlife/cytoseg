In this example variables are set to the following default values:

voxelTrainingImageFilePath = "data/membrane_training/image"
voxelTrainingLabelFilePath = "data/membrane_training/label"
inputImageFilePath = "data/membrane"

voxelTrainingImageFilePath - set this to the path of the image stack that will train the classifier
voxelTrainingLabelFilePath - set this to the path of the training pixel stack. This stack should have pixels with value 1 were the membrane is and 0 where it is not.
inputImageFilePath - set this to the path of the image stack you wish to use as a input data set
