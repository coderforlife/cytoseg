Uses connected components on thresholded images to locate blobs. Then uses a gradient decent (with particle repulsion) approach to locate the darkest point on each blob.

----------------------------
  * for larger blobs:
  * open image stack
  * set particle radius 10 pixels
  * set threshold 121
  * findBlobsThenParticleMovement
   * (300 iterations of particle movement will happen)

  * psi files will appear in tmp directory at each iteration

----------------------------
  * for smaller blobs:
  * set min blob size 6
  * set max blob size 5  (which means 53)
  * set threshold 121

  * uncheck "use subgroups"
  *  (no groups of particles or particle movement used)

  * click automatic process

  * save particles to output.psi
